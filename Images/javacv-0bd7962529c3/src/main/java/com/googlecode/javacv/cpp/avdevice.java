     * Libavdevice is a complementary library to @ref libavf "libavformat". It
     * provides various "special" platform-specific muxers and demuxers, e.g. for
     * grabbing devices, audio capture and playback etc. As a consequence, the
     * (de)muxers in libavdevice are of the AVFMT_NOFILE type (they use their own
     * I/O functions). The filename passed to avformat_open_input() often does not
     * refer to an actually existing file, but has some special device-specific
     * meaning - e.g. for the x11grab device it is the display name.
     *
     * To use libavdevice, simply call avdevice_register_all() to register all
     * compiled muxers and demuxers. They all use standard libavformat API.
